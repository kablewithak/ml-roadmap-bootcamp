# ============================================================================
# Loki Configuration (Log Aggregation)
# ============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS LOKI:
# "Like Prometheus, but for logs"
# - Prometheus: Stores metrics (numbers over time)
# - Loki: Stores logs (text over time)
#
# KEY DIFFERENCE FROM ELK STACK:
# - Elasticsearch: Indexes EVERY field in logs (expensive, but fast search)
# - Loki: Only indexes labels (cheap, but requires structured logs)
#
# COST COMPARISON:
# - ELK: 10M logs/day = 50GB indexed = $500/month
# - Loki: 10M logs/day = 5GB compressed = $50/month
#
# TRADE-OFF:
# - ✅ 10x cheaper storage
# - ✅ Simpler operations (no sharding, no complex tuning)
# - ❌ Slower full-text search (but LogQL is fast for label queries)
#
# WHEN TO USE LOKI:
# - Structured JSON logs with consistent labels
# - Grafana already used for metrics (unified UI)
# - Cost-sensitive (startup/mid-size companies)
#
# WHEN TO USE ELK:
# - Complex search requirements (regex across all fields)
# - Need to search unstructured logs
# - Large teams with dedicated ELK expertise
