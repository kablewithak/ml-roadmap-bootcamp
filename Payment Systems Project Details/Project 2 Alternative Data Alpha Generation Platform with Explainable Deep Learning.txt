Project 2: Alternative Data Alpha Generation Platform with Explainable Deep Learning
Why This Project:
This showcases the cutting edge of quantitative investing - using alternative data sources (satellite imagery, NLP on earnings calls, web scraping) combined with interpretable ML to generate alpha. It's what Renaissance Technologies, Two Sigma, and other top quant funds are actually doing. This extends your ML skills into unstructured data and requires building a complete research-to-production pipeline.
