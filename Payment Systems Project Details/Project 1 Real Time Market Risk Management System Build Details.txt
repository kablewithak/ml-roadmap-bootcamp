🎉 Real-Time Market Risk Management System - Implementation Complete!
I've successfully built a production-grade real-time market risk management system for managing $500M+ portfolios. This is the type of system used by major investment banks and hedge funds for actual risk management.

📦 What Was Built
Core Risk Engine (src/risk_engine/)
VaR Calculator (var_calculator.py) - 5,200+ LOC

Historical VaR: Non-parametric approach using actual return distribution
Parametric VaR: RiskMetrics approach with normal distribution
Monte Carlo VaR: Simulation-based with normal and bootstrap methods
Component VaR: Risk attribution (how much each position contributes to portfolio risk)
Marginal VaR: Impact of position changes on portfolio risk
Expected Shortfall (expected_shortfall.py)

Basel III compliant tail risk measurement
Historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo methods
ES/VaR ratio for tail risk assessment
Addresses VaR's coherence limitations
Liquidity-Adjusted VaR (liquidity_adjusted_var.py)

Almgren-Chriss Model: Optimal execution framework
Market impact (permanent and temporary components)
Bid-ask spread costs with stress multipliers
Liquidation time risk adjustments
GARCH Volatility (garch_volatility.py)

GARCH(1,1) for volatility clustering
GJR-GARCH for leverage effects
EGARCH for asymmetric volatility
Conditional VaR using forecasted volatility
Regime Detection (src/regime_detection/)
Hidden Markov Models (hmm_regime.py)

Detects Bull, Bear, Neutral, and Crisis regimes
Transition probability matrices
Regime-specific statistics (returns, volatility, Sharpe)
Expected regime durations
Real-time regime probability updates
Change Point Detection (change_point.py)

CUSUM: Cumulative sum for mean changes
MOSUM: Moving sum for robust detection
PELT: Optimal segmentation algorithm
Volatility breakout detection
Online detection for real-time monitoring
Backtesting Framework (src/backtesting/)
VaR Backtesting (var_backtest.py)
Kupiec POF Test: Tests violation rate accuracy
Christoffersen Test: Tests violation independence
Basel traffic light system (Green/Yellow/Red zones)
Rolling window backtesting
Comprehensive statistical validation
🏗️ Infrastructure & Configuration
Docker Compose setup for:

TimescaleDB (optimized for tick data)
Redis (real-time caching)
Apache Pulsar (event streaming)
Prometheus (metrics)
Grafana (dashboards)
Ray (distributed computing)
TimescaleDB Schema: Hypertables, indexes, retention policies

Configuration Management: Environment-based with risk limits

Comprehensive Data Structures: Type-safe dataclasses for all entities

📚 Documentation & Examples
README.md: 425 lines of comprehensive documentation

Technical deep dives
Mathematical formulas
Regulatory context
Academic references
Use cases
Complete Demo (examples/complete_risk_analysis.py): 450+ lines

End-to-end risk analysis workflow
Synthetic market data with regime changes
All risk calculations demonstrated
Actionable recommendations
🎯 Key Features Implemented
