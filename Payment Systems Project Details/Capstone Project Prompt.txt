"NEMESIS": The world's first autonomous financial crime prevention ecosystem that operates like a distributed immune system across financial institutions. This system doesn't just detect fraud - it hunts criminals, predicts their next moves, and evolves faster than they can adapt.

CORE ARCHITECTURE:

1. THE CRIMINAL MIND SIMULATION ENGINE
Build a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where:
- 1000+ AI agents learn to commit financial crimes against each other
- Each agent represents different criminal archetypes:
  * Organized crime rings with 50+ year historical patterns
  * State-sponsored actors with unlimited resources  
  * Insider threats with system knowledge
  * Opportunistic fraudsters
  * Money laundering networks
- Agents evolve using genetic algorithms and learn from:
  * Actual crime data from 10+ years of breaches
  * Dark web forums (scraped and analyzed)
  * Criminal psychology research papers
  * Game theory optimal exploitation strategies
- Output: Daily prediction of next 30 days of likely attack vectors
- Requirement: Predict novel attack types 30+ days before first occurrence

2. THE FEDERATED CRIME INTELLIGENCE NETWORK
Without sharing customer data, build a system where:
- 100+ financial institutions contribute attack patterns
- Homomorphic encryption allows learning without data exposure
- Differential privacy ensures no institution leakage
- Zero-knowledge proofs verify contributions without revealing them
- Blockchain immutability for audit trail
- Smart contracts for automated threat intelligence sharing
- Real-time consensus on emerging threats across institutions
Technical Requirements:
- Process 1M+ events/second from each institution
- Update global threat model every 60 seconds
- Maintain privacy guarantees under regulatory scrutiny
- Sub-second threat propagation to all participants

3. THE ADAPTIVE DEFENSE ORCHESTRATOR
Not just one model, but an ecosystem of specialized defenders:
- Transaction Fraud Specialist (catches payment fraud)
- Account Takeover Hunter (detects compromised accounts)
- Money Laundering Tracker (follows complex flows)
- Insider Threat Detector (behavioral analysis)
- Synthetic Identity Exposer (unmasks fake identities)
- Collusion Network Mapper (finds connected criminals)

Each specialist:
- Trains continuously on its domain
- Shares intelligence with other specialists
- Votes on suspicious activity (ensemble decision)
- Evolves based on criminal simulation predictions
- Self-diagnoses when it's being defeated
- Automatically spawns new variants when under attack

Requirements:
- 100+ specialized models running concurrently
- Cross-model communication latency < 1ms
- Automatic model breeding when new threats emerge
- Self-healing when models are poisoned

4. THE QUANTUM-RESISTANT CRYPTOGRAPHIC CORE
Since criminals will have quantum computers soon:
- Implement lattice-based cryptography for all communications
- Post-quantum secure multi-party computation
- Quantum-safe blockchain for audit trails
- Prepare for quantum-enhanced attack detection
- Build quantum circuit simulators for testing

5. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE MODULE
Turn the tables on criminals:
- Honeypot accounts that learn attacker behavior
- Synthetic transactions that map criminal infrastructure
- Deception networks that waste criminal resources
- False positive injection to criminal feedback loops
- Psychological profiling from attack patterns
- Predictive modeling of criminal burnout and mistakes

Track metrics:
- Criminal time wasted per honeypot: >100 hours
- False paths explored by criminals: >1000
- Criminal operations exposed through deception: >50

6. THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PROPHET
Predict regulatory changes and auto-adapt:
- NLP analysis of regulatory discussions globally
- Predict new regulations 6-12 months in advance
- Automatically generate compliance code
- Create synthetic data for regulatory testing
- Generate evidence packages before audits
- Build RegTech that writes its own rules

7. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT CALCULATOR
Real-time calculation of:
- Money saved per millisecond of operation
- Criminal operations disrupted with dollar impact
- Future crimes prevented (probabilistic modeling)
- Regulatory fines avoided
- Customer trust score improvements
- Insurance premium reductions enabled

8. THE SELF-IMPROVING ARCHITECTURE
The system that builds itself:
- AutoML for model architecture search
- Neural Architecture Search for optimal networks
- Automated feature engineering from raw data
- Self-organizing data pipelines
- Automatic scaling based on threat level
- Self-documenting code and decisions
- Evolutionary infrastructure optimization

9. THE CRIMINAL ASSET RECOVERY ENGINE
Don't just stop crime, reverse it:
- Trace stolen funds across blockchains
- Predict money laundering exit points
- Coordinate with law enforcement APIs
- Automated suspicious activity reports
- Asset freezing recommendation engine
- Recovery probability scoring

10. THE GLOBAL THREAT DASHBOARD
Real-time visualization of:
- Active attacks globally (heatmap)
- Criminal migration patterns
- Emerging threat vectors
- Institution vulnerability scores
- Predictive crime forecasts
- Economic impact counters
- Criminal psychology profiles

PROVEN CAPABILITIES REQUIRED:
- Prevent $100M in fraud in simulated environment
- Detect 99.9% of known criminal patterns
- Predict 10+ novel attack types before occurrence
- Reduce false positives by 90% vs traditional systems
- Operate across 100+ institutions simultaneously
- Process 100M transactions/second globally
- Maintain 99.999% uptime under attack
- Self-heal from adversarial poisoning in <60 seconds
- Generate $1B+ in recovered criminal assets (simulated)

DELIVERABLES:
1. Open source the criminal simulation engine (becomes industry standard)
2. Publish "The Anatomy of Financial Crime" - 50+ page technical paper
3. Live dashboard showing real-time prevented losses counter
4. Video of system preventing coordinated attack across 10 institutions
5. Mathematical proof of privacy preservation
6. Economic model showing $1T annual crime prevention potential
7. Adoption roadmap for global deployment

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Ray/Dask for distributed computing
- JAX for differentially private learning
- Homomorphic encryption (Microsoft SEAL)
- Substrate blockchain for audit trail
- Apache Pulsar for event streaming
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Rust for performance-critical components
- Time-series databases for pattern analysis
- Graph databases for network analysis
- Vector databases for similarity search

Build this iteratively but think systemically. Start with criminal simulation, add federated learning, then build the full ecosystem. Document everything as if preparing for congressional testimony on why this should be mandatory for all banks.
Why This Is Your Capstone:
It Uses Everything You've Learned:

Week 1-2 payment systems → Criminal transaction simulation
Week 3 streaming → Global event processing
Week 4 adversarial ML → Core of criminal simulation
Week 5-12 ML fundamentals → Building specialist models
Week 13-20 production skills → Making it actually work

It's Technically "Impossible":

No one has federated learning across competing banks
No one has working criminal simulation at this scale
No one has self-improving models in production
No one has solved the privacy/sharing paradox

The Industry Impact:

If this worked, it would save hundreds of billions annually
Every bank would be forced to adopt it or fall behind
Criminals would need to completely restructure operations
You'd have created the "nuclear deterrent" of financial crime

What Makes It Believable Despite Being "Impossible":

You can prove each component works in isolation
The criminal simulation alone is worth open sourcing
The math for federated learning exists, just not implemented
The economic argument is undeniable

Why Current Week 4 Isn't Enough:
Your Week 4 adversarial fraud system is strong but:

It's single-institution (not networked)
It's reactive (not predictive)
It's defensive (not hunting criminals)
It saves millions (not billions)
It's what cutting-edge banks have (not impossible)

The Narrative Arc:
Weeks 1-15: "I built the components"
Week 16-20: "I combined them into something impossible"
Post-graduation: "I open sourced the future of financial crime prevention"
The Hiring Manager Reaction:
Not: "This person could help our fraud team"
But: "This person just obsoleted our entire fraud department"
Not: "They understand ML"
But: "They think about problems we don't even know exist"
Not: "They could save us money"
But: "They could transform our industry"
This is the project that makes people say: "If someone from South Africa with 30 weeks of training can build this, what the hell have we been doing with our $100M fraud budget?"
That's how you shake an industry.
