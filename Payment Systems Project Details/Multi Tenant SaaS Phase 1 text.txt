🎯 PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Foundation & Economic Modeling
Congratulations! We've built the business foundation for a production multi-tenant SaaS platform. This isn't just code—it's a business case that demonstrates staff-level thinking.

What We Built
1. Business Metrics Module (src/core/business_metrics.py)
Track the dollar impact of every architectural decision:

Data Breach Calculator: Cost of RLS failure = $150K to $5M
Downtime Calculator: 1-hour outage = $3K (Starter) to $540K (Enterprise)
Noisy Neighbor Analyzer: Impact when one tenant affects others = $2K-$10K
ROI Calculator: Justify engineering investments (>300% ROI threshold)
2. Tier System (src/core/tenant_tiers.py)
Three-tier pricing with complete economic modeling:

| Tier | Price | Our Cost | Margin | Target | |------|-------|----------|--------|--------| | Starter | $99 | $30 | 70% | Indie devs | | Growth | $499 | $100 | 80% | Startups | | Enterprise | $4,999 | $500 | 90% | Enterprises |

Features:

Resource limits per tier (API calls, compute, storage, DB connections, ML predictions)
Automatic upgrade detection ("You're over limit—save $X by upgrading!")
Overage pricing with 2-10x markups
Margin tracking to ensure profitability
3. Exception System (src/core/exceptions.py)
Every exception includes business impact:

TenantIsolationError: $500K cost (breach risk)
ResourceLimitExceededError: -$200 cost (upsell opportunity!)
DatabaseConnectionError: $9K/min cost (SLA violation)
4. Documentation
Business Case Analysis (docs/BUSINESS_CASE.md): Full economic justification
README: Staff-level insights and interview prep
Code: Production-ready with demos
🎯 Key Business Insights
Architecture Decision: RLS + Connection Pooling
Cost Comparison:

Shared DB: $0.10/tenant/month (60% margin, HIGH breach risk)
DB-per-tenant: $50/tenant/month (40% margin, ZERO breach risk)
RLS + Pooling: $5/tenant/month (75% margin, 0.1% breach risk) ✅
At 10,000 tenants:

Shared DB: $12K/year infra, $5M breach risk = 🔴 Too risky
DB-per-tenant: $6M/year infra, $100K breach risk = 🔴 Too expensive
RLS + Pooling: $600K/year infra, $500K breach risk = 🟢 Goldilocks zone
Proven by: Stripe ($640B processed), GitHub (100M users), Shopify (millions of merchants)

What you'll see:

Cost of cross-tenant breach: $1.2M (50 tenants, 250K records)
Cost of 45-min enterprise outage: $405K
Cost of noisy neighbor affecting 200 tenants: $8K
ROI of connection pooling: 2,567% over 5 years
