Create a fraud signal collection system integrated with our payment processing:

1. Basic Velocity Tracking (Redis):
   - Transactions per 5min, 1hr for card_id, user_id, ip_address
   - Simple counter implementation with TTL
   - Fast lookup for payment-time decisions (<10ms)

2. Transaction Pattern Signals:
   - Amount velocity (sum in time window)
   - Merchant category frequency
   - Day/hour patterns
   - First-time card usage flag

3. Risk Score Calculation:
   - Simple weighted rule system
   - Configurable thresholds
   - Return risk_score, signals_triggered, decision

4. Integration with Payment Flow:
   - Check signals BEFORE Stripe charge
   - Log all signals to Kafka for future ML training
   - Store decisions for reconciliation

5. Test Scenarios:
   - Card testing pattern (multiple small charges)
   - Velocity breach scenarios
   - New card high-value transaction

Focus: Production-ready, fast (<50ms total), integrated with existing payment system.
Generate performance benchmarks showing latency at different TPS rates.
