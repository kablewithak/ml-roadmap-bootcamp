Prompt to Claude Code:
Build adversarial ML system for fraud detection:

1. Attack simulator:
   - 10 realistic attack patterns:
     * Card testing (test 1000 cards with $1 each)
     * Account takeover chain (login → change email → purchase)
     * Velocity evasion (stay under limits)
     * Synthetic identity (fake person, real SSN pattern)
     * Device rotation attack
     * IP rotation via proxies
     * Blend attack (mix with legitimate traffic)
     * Slow burn attack (low volume over time)
     * BIN attack (test card number ranges)
     * Gift card cashout chain
   
2. Each pattern includes:
   - Realistic timing (not all at once)
   - Adaptive behavior (learn from blocks)
   - Success metrics
   - Historical loss estimation

3. Adversarial learning:
   - RL agent that learns from defense responses
   - Strategy evolution based on success rate
   - Attack campaign simulator (multi-day)

4. Defense system:
   - Adversarially robust ML model training
   - Feature engineering resistant to gaming
   - Online learning with poisoning detection
   - Ensemble defense (rules + ML + graph)

5. Graph-based fraud detection:
   - Build transaction graph (NetworkX)
   - Community detection for fraud rings
   - Shortest path to known fraud
   - Graph-based features for ML

6. Evaluation framework:
   - Attack success rate over time
   - Defense degradation measurement
   - ROC curves under adversarial conditions
   - Cost analysis (prevented vs cost of defense)

Include:
- Comprehensive test suite
- Visualization of attack patterns
- Defense effectiveness reports
- Open-source ready structure
