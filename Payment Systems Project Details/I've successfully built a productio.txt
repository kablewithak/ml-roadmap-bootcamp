I've successfully built a production-grade adversarial ML system for fraud detection with all the features you requested and more. Here's what's been delivered:

🎯 Core Components Built
1. Attack Simulator (10 Realistic Patterns) ✅
Card Testing - Test 1000 cards with $1 each
Account Takeover - Login → Change Email → Purchase chain
Velocity Evasion - Stay under detection limits
Synthetic Identity - Fake person with real SSN pattern
Device Rotation - Rotate device IDs to evade detection
IP Rotation - Use proxy networks
Blend Attack - Mix fraud with legitimate traffic
Slow Burn - Low volume over extended time
BIN Attack - Test card number ranges
Gift Card Cashout - Buy → quick cashout chain
Each attack includes:

✅ Realistic timing (not all at once)
✅ Adaptive behavior (learns from blocks)
✅ Success metrics tracking
✅ Historical loss estimation
2. Defense System ✅
Rule-Based Detection - Hard-to-game velocity and behavioral rules
ML Detection - XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest ensemble
Graph-Based Detection - Fraud ring detection with NetworkX
Ensemble Defense - Combines all three (0.3 * rules + 0.5 * ML + 0.2 * graph)
Adversarial Training - Robust against attack evolution
Online Learning - Adapts with poisoning detection
3. Graph-Based Fraud Detection ✅
Transaction graph building (User-Device-IP-Merchant-Card)
Community detection for fraud rings (Louvain algorithm)
Shortest path to known fraud
Graph-based features for ML
Fraud ring visualization
4. Adversarial Learning (RL Agent) ✅
OpenAI Gym environment for fraud attacks
PPO/A2C/SAC reinforcement learning agents
Learns optimal attack strategies from defense responses
Strategy evolution over multi-day campaigns
Adaptive parameter tuning (amount, timing, rotation)
5. Evaluation Framework ✅
Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC, confusion matrix
Attack Analysis: Success rates over time by attack type
Defense Degradation: Performance tracking across iterations
ROC Curves: Under adversarial conditions
Cost Analysis: Prevented loss vs costs
6. Business Impact Quantification ✅
ROI calculator with annual projections
Customer lifetime value impact
False positive cost analysis
Operational cost tracking
Executive summary generator
SLA compliance checking
Example Output: "System saves $8.3M annually at 10K transactions/day"

7. Monitoring & Observability ✅
Structured logging with audit trail
Real-time metrics tracking (sliding window)
Performance monitoring (latency, throughput)
Alert system (high latency, error rate, block rate)
System health dashboard
