# Shadow Mode Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Headline: How spending $450 on random approvals unlocked $12,000 in safe revenue**

This report compares the performance of two credit risk models:
- **Model V1**: Standard model trained only on approved loans
- **Model V2**: Causal model trained with IPW on exploration data

## Key Findings

### Revenue Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exploration Cost | $450 |
| New Good Loans Found | 28 |
| Lifetime Value per Loan | $500 |
| Gross Revenue from New Loans | $14,000 |
| **Net Revenue Lift** | **$13,550** |

### Model Performance

| Metric | Model V1 | Model V2 | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| AUC-ROC | 0.72 | 0.79 | +9.7% |
| Precision | 0.68 | 0.74 | +8.8% |
| Recall | 0.61 | 0.71 | +16.4% |
| F1 Score | 0.64 | 0.72 | +12.5% |
| Blindness Score | 0.65 | 0.32 | -50.8% |

### Population Coverage

The causal model successfully identifies a previously rejected segment:

**"High Income but Thin Credit History"**

- Population Size: ~3% of applicants
- Previous Approval Rate: 12%
- New Approval Rate: 67%
- Default Rate in Segment: 4.2% (below average)

## Methodology

### Exploration Strategy
- Epsilon: 0.01 (1% exploration rate)
- Total Applications: 100,000
- Exploration Approvals: ~1,000
- Exploration Defaults: 9 ($450 cost)

### IPW Weighting
Exploration samples weighted 100x higher than exploitation samples:
```
weight = 1/P(approval) = 1/0.01 = 100
```

### Training Details
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Cross-validation: 5-fold
- Test Size: 20%

## Decision Boundary Shift

The causal model expands the approval boundary to include:
1. High income (>$80k) with short credit history (<24 months)
2. Recent job changers with strong income growth
3. Self-employed with consistent revenue streams

These populations were previously rejected due to model uncertainty, not actual risk.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy Model V2** to production with A/B test
2. **Continue exploration** at 0.5% rate (reduced from 1%)
3. **Monitor segments** "High Income Thin File" for outcome drift
4. **Consider fairness** implications of expanded approval boundary
