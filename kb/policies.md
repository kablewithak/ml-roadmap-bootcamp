# Company Policies

## Code of Conduct

All team members are expected to maintain a professional, respectful, and inclusive environment. This includes treating colleagues with dignity, avoiding discriminatory language, and fostering open communication. Harassment of any kind, including verbal, physical, or digital harassment, is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.

We value diverse perspectives and encourage team members to share ideas, even when they differ from the majority opinion. Constructive disagreement is healthy and leads to better outcomes. However, criticism should always focus on ideas and work products, not individuals.

## Remote Work Policy

Team members may work remotely up to three days per week, with approval from their manager. Remote workers are expected to maintain regular communication through Slack and attend all scheduled meetings via video conference. Core collaboration hours are 10 AM to 3 PM in your local timezone.

When working remotely, ensure you have a reliable internet connection and a quiet workspace for meetings. Use the company VPN for accessing internal resources. Report any security incidents or equipment issues immediately to IT support. Remote work is a privilege that may be revoked if performance or communication suffers.

## Data Security

All company data must be handled according to its classification level: Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted. Never share confidential or restricted data outside approved channels. Use encryption for sensitive files and never store credentials in plain text or commit them to version control.

When working with customer data, follow data minimization principles: only access what you need, when you need it. Delete temporary copies of sensitive data after use. Report any suspected data breaches to the security team within 24 hours, even if you're unsure whether actual exposure occurred.

## Development Practices

All code changes must go through pull request review before merging to main. PRs require at least one approval from a team member. Write meaningful commit messages and include tests for new functionality. Our target is 80% code coverage for new code.

Use the project's established code style (enforced by ruff and black) and follow the team's naming conventions. Document public APIs and non-obvious implementation details. Before starting major changes, discuss the approach in a design document or team meeting to align on direction.

## Time Off and Leave

Full-time employees receive 20 days of paid time off per year, plus company holidays. Request time off at least two weeks in advance for vacations longer than three days. Use the HR portal to submit and track requests. Managers approve based on team needs and project deadlines.

Sick leave is separate from PTO and should be used when you're unwell or need to care for a sick family member. You don't need to provide details about your illness, but do notify your manager as early as possible. Extended medical leave (more than five consecutive days) requires HR coordination.
