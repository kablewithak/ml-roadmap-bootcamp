## 💡 KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### The Daily Non-Negotiables
1. **750 lines minimum** - No exceptions
2. **3 patterns identified** - Name them precisely
3. **1 business calculation** - Dollar impact
4. **1 modification experiment** - Break something
5. **1 insight documented** - Knowledge capture

### The Weekly Checkpoints
- Monday: Set 3 concrete goals
- Wednesday: Mid-week pattern review
- Friday: Progress assessment
- Sunday: Week synthesis & planning

### The Mental Shift
```python
# FROM: "I need to read code"
# TO:   "I need to understand systems"

# FROM: "This is complex"
# TO:   "What problem required this complexity?"

# FROM: "I don't understand this"
# TO:   "What would Stripe do? Why?"

# FROM: "This seems like a lot"
# TO:   "Every line saves/makes money"
```

## 🎓 YOUR LEARNING PHILOSOPHY

### The Four Pillars

1. **BUSINESS FIRST**
   - Every line of code has a dollar value
   - Every pattern prevents a crisis
   - Every system makes or saves money

2. **PATTERNS OVER SYNTAX**
   - Recognize the pattern, adapt the implementation
   - Know when NOT to use a pattern
   - Understand trade-offs deeply

3. **FAILURE THINKING**
   - How does this break?
   - What's the cost when it breaks?
   - How do we detect and recover?

4. **SCALE CONSCIOUSNESS**
   - Works at 1x, breaks at 10x
   - Different patterns at different scales
   - Cost per transaction matters
